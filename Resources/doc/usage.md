# Usage

The QuizBundle comes with a set of predefined urls to point to basic controllers so you can start using the bundle
out of the box. but these controllers are basic ones so you can test the bundle to see if it fits your needs.

## Controllers

All the controllers mostly implements one of the three available services (see services section for more information).
Except for those who are used for listings, where they just call the Entity Manager.

  - QuizManagerController.php: for CRUD on Quizes. 
  - QuestionController.php: for CRUD on Questions.
  - QuizController.php: for "taking" a Quiz.
  - AnswerController.php: for creating Answers

If you want to personalize any of the controllers you can just pick the services and create your own Controllers with
them.
